# 📄 AI Legal Document Q&A App

An **AI-powered document assistant** that allows users to upload documents and interact with them through a chatbot interface. Users can ask natural language questions about their uploaded documents and receive intelligent answers based on document content.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone and Setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd user-doc-chat
   npm install
   ```

2. **Generate Secrets**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/generate-secrets.sh
   ```

3. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-secure.yml up -d
   ```

> 📖 **For detailed setup instructions, see [Setup Guide](./docs/SETUP.md)**

## 🎯 What It Does

The AI Legal Document Q&A App enables users to:

- **Upload Documents**: Securely upload PDF, DOCX, and TXT files
- **Ask Questions**: Use natural language to query document content
- **Get AI Answers**: Receive intelligent responses based on document analysis
- **Chat Interface**: Interactive conversation with document context
- **Vector Search**: Find relevant information using semantic search

### Example Use Case

Upload a legal contract and ask: *"What are the key obligations mentioned in this document?"*

The system will:
1. Process and vectorize the document
2. Use AI to understand your question
3. Find relevant sections using semantic search
4. Generate a comprehensive answer with source references

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js 22.14.0 (TypeScript, Express) with modular architecture
- **AI/LLM**: Hugging Face Transformers, OpenAI API
- **Vector Store**: PostgreSQL + pgvector, Pinecone
- **Storage**: MinIO/S3-compatible storage
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Redis caching
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose

## 🔒 Security

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Secure Deployment

**If you have used default MinIO credentials (`minioadmin`/`minioadmin`) in production, you MUST rotate them immediately:**

```bash
./scripts/rotate-minio-credentials.sh
```

> 📖 **See [Secure Deployment Guide](./docs/SECURE_DEPLOYMENT.md) for comprehensive security setup instructions**

### Security Features

- **Secrets Management**: Secure credential management with Docker secrets, Kubernetes secrets, and cloud secrets managers
- **Credential Rotation**: Automated scripts for rotating sensitive credentials
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **CORS**: Configurable CORS settings
- **SSRF Protection**: Protection against Server-Side Request Forgery attacks
- **Private IP Protection**: Prevents access to private IP addresses

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The application follows a **modular domain-driven design** with clear separation of concerns:

```
src/
├── domains/           # Domain-specific modules
│   ├── auth/         # Authentication domain
│   ├── files/        # File management domain
│   ├── chat/         # Chat and Q&A domain
│   └── vector/       # Vector operations domain
├── infrastructure/   # External integrations
│   ├── database/     # Database repositories
│   ├── external-services/ # AI, search, storage
│   └── monitoring/   # Observability tools
└── shared/          # Common utilities
    ├── middleware/   # Express middleware
    ├── utils/       # Utility functions
    └── types/       # Type definitions
```

### Key Benefits

- **Domain Separation**: Each feature is self-contained
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new features or modify existing ones
- **Maintainability**: Related code is grouped together
- **Testability**: Tests are co-located with their modules
- **Team Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different modules
