# Project Standards
- Language: Typescript, Python, NodeJS
- Framework: Express with typescript and Python
- Current Issues: Mixed logic in /src, no domain separation.
- Goals: Modular by feature (e.g., /auth, /tasks), separation of concerns (controllers/services), error handling, logging, tests per module.
- Best Practices: CamelCase naming, scalable config, use pino logger for logging.
